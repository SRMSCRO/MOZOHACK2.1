# DESCRIPTION OF OUR WEBSITE

## THE STORY:
Team SCRO presents a unique portal, build to combine goodness (quite literally). 
How, you ask?
Well, the concept at its very core is to combine two very different aspects of humanity together. The pandemic of CoVid 19 might have brought the world to a halt; it was also responsible for showing just how compassionate humanity was. I ways unknown, it restored our faith in humanity. We saw people come together like never before to help those in need. Whether it was donating grocery, volunteering at hospitals, donating blood or simply donating money, it was an amalgamation of all things good. There were two aspects of humanity at play here, the one who created the opportunity to work and others who worked. Whatever the scenario, a charity or donation portal was the strongest suit to help those in need. 
But, more often than not, the charities or donation portals were misplaced amid the hoard of them available. Amid them, some found the opportunity to gain money for selfish reasons. And sometimes, just sometimes, it was hard to distinguish between volunteering and donating. 
Well, what Team SCRO brings is a unified, an easily navigable and extremely user friendly portal that combines charities and enables donations, all the whilst celebrating humanity for its very essence.

## THE PORTAL:
The project is titled Easy Help for obvious reasons. It is, in the simplest terms, a unified database of all major charities. All charities are listen in one place helping with easy selection, verification and navigation so that it is made sure the money reaches the correct people and passed to the people in dire need. 
This portal is most effective due to the different views available; the admin view, the donor view and the charity organizer view.  
The admin view has the power to accept and reject charities and donation portals based on the authenticity so that the donors aren’t fooled. They can also monitor usage as well as list and add/delete charities depending on the date and goal reached. The admins’ can also update the gallery to showcase charity and volunteer work. The admin view is responsible for the overall maintenance of the authenticity of the portal and the listed charities. 
The donor view enables the user to do two things, donate and volunteer. 
You can surf the charities and directly donate money to your preferred charity by filling your credentials and the amount after which you will be asked for your banking details for the ease of online payments. All you have to give is 5 minutes to do your part. 
The other good you can do is to volunteer. It is general scenario that the places that are trying to do some good are mostly understaffed. Hence, volunteering is all the help they need. You can go through these places listed on the portal and volunteer yourself by filing out your credentials and selecting your preferred place to volunteer. After this, you will be registered volunteer and you will be contacted when you help would be donated. Someone once said, “The greatest gift you can ever give is your time”. Well, it is true. 
Additionally, there is one more thing enabled, clothes drop off. It is common to find your wardrobe overflowing with clothes you don’t wear anymore (or don’t fit in, ouch (or not?)). Well, this shouldn’t have to be a problem when there are people who don’t have clothes to wear. There would be dedicated spots that will tell you where you can drop off all these extra clothing. You will be personally able to verify and substantiate the authenticity.
Now, you would ask, how to navigate to these volunteer places and cloth drop off zones? Well, there is a solution to that too, a Map. Simple, right? The portal accesses your location and then provides physical location for these charities and drop zones. This also helps to notify you when a charity event pops up in your neighborhood. 
Well, this isn’t all. There is so much more this portal is capable off. 
There is an option for a charity to register itself and host online charity event attracting a wide audience to work towards a common cause. There is a dedicated events page that lists all events for you to attend to. 
The people you help will never forget you, neither will this server. You are to create an account and password to protect the same to proceed to volunteering and donating. You will always be remembered for your humanity.
There is also a feature to send queries regarding a charity or donation portal. The query centre will also answer questions regarding volunteer jobs and cloth drop off zones. 
On that, there is a big bonus in the fact that small charities can combine with more stable charities to increase their audience and expand their forums so that no one is left out in the state of helplessness.
